##2ch-Gallery

An userscript that creates gallery view for russian imageboard _2ch_.

#####Installation
- Install browser specific add-on eg. **Greasemonkey**.
- Open `2ch-Gallery` directory in this repo and click `Raw`.
- Open some thread - you'll see what to do.
- PROFIT!

#####Feautures
- Arrow keys support, so you can scroll you pictures while holding a cup of tea!
- WebM support - we don't want to miss such a thing, do we?
- It loads only when you ask to, hence it doesn't slow page loading.

#####Other
It wasn't created specially for 2ch, it's a port from other usersript, which is now a part of the other userscript, so it's now discontinued. Anyway i would be glad to see your pull requests and issue reports.
